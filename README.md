" Go into Void Linux with our 'Arch Linux-style' guide! 💻🐧"

## Pre-Installation:

1. **Acquiring the Installation Image:**
   - Visit the [Void Linux Download page](https://voidlinux.org/download/) and obtain the base image for x86_64 Architecture (glibc). If using a different version, adjustments may be necessary.
   
2. **Prepare an Installation Medium:**
   - Use a tool such as:
     - Rufus: [Download Rufus](https://rufus.ie) (for Windows users 😂)
     - Etcher: [Download Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io) (recommended for its cross-platform compatibility 💀💙)
     - Ventoy: [Download Ventoy](https://ventoy.net) (useful for burning multiple .iso files, but may encounter errors)

3. **Boot the Live Environment:**
- Depending on your PC/laptop, press {Esc, F9, F12, ...} to bring the boot menu and boot from the
installation medium you set up. If you have the boot menu disabled, you can change the boot order from the
BIOS. Once you boot into Void, log in using root as the username and voidlinux as the password. Start the
bash shell using the command `PS1='[ W ] # ' /bin/bash`.
